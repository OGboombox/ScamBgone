# ScamBgone
vibe coding my way to understanding and getting rid of these damn scam texts.

**Using this as my public "to-do" list and vision board**

Iphone sends metadata to the app, including sender number, message type (sms, mms) and country codes.
Iphone will err on the side of "ALLOW" if the program takes longer than a few miliseconds.
IPhone user must opt in by Settings → Messages → Unknown & Spam → SMS Filtering → Your App. Hopefully I can automate this for users.
I want "per-user" events to be tracked and algorythmicly processed by ML to tailor anti-scam metrics to a user device. **Research this
I want a local ML algo to determine numeric float values for each "bad" word based on web-scraped data or other Publicly Available Information (PAI) This data will be packaged and sent to users. 


Reiterate:*
I want A webscrapper to pull the most common and well known scam messages to train my models on. Additionally, this data will be put into the lightweight json file that will be installed on users phones.

I'm not sure what the weights should be yet, I will need to think about my options more.
